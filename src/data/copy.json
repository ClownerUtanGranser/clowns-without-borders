The trained artists has then worked with women and girls in their local communities and together met over 2500 people. <br/><br/> The importance of the creative arts is the ability to express all of the feelings through it. This is something that gives a feeling of freedom in general, and psychological freedom in particular; this leads to equality and gives the strength to do many things in life. This is the link between arts and using it, which helps to achieve safety and equality."

This is something Clowns Without Borders Sweden has worked to provide in war and conflict areas since 1996, all with the aim to strengthen children’s health and rights.<br/><br/> During these years, we have closely witnessed how girls and women are an especially vulnerable group and how gender-based violence is a significant problem around the world.  Women and girls are marginalized in their societies on a regular basis and can’t participate in the same ways as men and boys."

    "body": "Women are generally expected to fulfill traditional female gender roles such as taking care of the household, getting married and having children. During war times, such as the one in Syria right now, women are also expected to take on  traditional masculine responsibilities, such as securing the family’s daily requirements, but still not with the same possibilities and rights as men have. So what is needed for girls and women to get access to their fundamental rights in a man’s world? <br/><br/> That is a question we at Clowns Without Borders Sweden have asked ourselves many times and is also one of the reasons we started the project Creative Arts for Peace and Equality, also called CAPE. It’s a project created to support girls and women who are affected by war and conflict, minority groups, groups in vulnerable economic situations, women and girls exposed to violence and harassment and people affected by the harbor explosions in Lebanon, by strengthening their psychosocial wellbeing – a way to find peace within while working for peace in the world. And how are we doing this? Well the first clue you can find in the project's name – we work for peace and equality by using creative arts. Keep on reading to find out more about our specific methods, way of work and to hear more from the girls and women participating in the project."

A network that together works for strengthening girls and women in their local society through psychosocial support workshops, as well as spreading awareness and commitment to peace and equality in the region. <br/><br/> In this type of work, a good network is key and even though the trained artists have worked by themselves and in their own local community throughout the project, they have kept in constant contact, being each other's inspiration and support. <br/><br/> The artists and trainers also became role models for the participating girls and women in the project. Because of their visibility, artists engaging and speaking openly about such issues can help to spread the message of peace and equality. <br/><br/> Peace is spoken of here in terms of psychological peace and comfort, of being able to be positive and have peace of mind, and of managing differences in points of view, whether religious or political, with the goal of someday reaching equality. It’s like planting the seeds and watching how they develop – both enriching and stimulating."

Since then she has been a big part of the work in Syria, contributing to making the project spread to other regions in Syria and inspiring many girls and women to participate in the workshops. These are her words: <br/><br/> “The situation in Syria is very sad. We face new tragedies every day. It’s not even about a country anymore, it’s about us trying to survive. <br/><br/> My name is Ghinwa and I come from the Northern part of Syria. I call it the sad North as it suffers not only from open clashes and displacements, but also of exhaustion and depression. I used to see the North as an example of prosperity and pluralism, rich with natural resources and diversified with ethnicities and nationalities. Here Kurds, Assyrians, Armenians, Arabs, Chaldeans, Turks, you name it, all lived in harmony together. But this great human wealth has now turned into a curse. Fear and hate are dominating people. This politics has exceeded a whole society that once was happy is destroyed. <br/><br/> Women in Syria used to have high social status. They were ambitious co-workers, mothers, sisters, friends, daughters. Today, a woman in Syria is a broken creature filled with sadness and fear. Fear of death, fear of loss, fear of being used and harassed. Lots of efforts are needed to bring back humanity, life and dignity to Syrian women. <br/><br/> After my participation in Clowns Without Borders training, I carried my new filled luggage and headed back home to the Sad North. The luggage was filled with laughter, positive energy and humanity. This I directly started to share with my fellow women. During weeks I gathered and trained a group of women in the methods I had been taught. Often, we met in secret in each other’s living rooms since public gatherings are forbidden in Syria. These women are now doing these training themselves. Today they work with women and girls who are exposed to child marriages, depression, violence, fear and social constraints. For the first time they are openly sharing their horrible experiences and the fact that we are so many carrying the same experiences makes me hold on to my luggage even harder. I want to create smaller bags out of it and distribute this psychosocial first aid kit to every girl and woman. <br/><br/> It hurts to see a whole civilization, nation and humanity totally destroyed. Today my home lacks love, confidence and trust. All Syrian’s live in a constant crisis on all levels. But despite all this sadness, I still have hope. Hope of a better world. The luggage I carry keeps being filled with new laughter, positive energy and humanity, for every new woman I meet. It’s what makes me survive.” "

The economic situation is difficult due to the Caesar Act, the United States legislation that sanctions the Syrian government for war crimes against the Syrian population. This caused our country’s currency to collapse, which affected the lives of ordinary people who are paying the price of the Syrian crisis. <br/><br/> Before the war I was living a very comfortable life with my family in Damascus. I moved to Aleppo when I got married. Then I got divorced from my husband, who didn’t want to stay in Syria, and suddenly I was alone. On top of this, I am working on a temporary contract within the humanitarian sector. If I lose my job, it will be hard to get a decent employment under these circumstances.

The women were open to learn new things and to have a new experience in life. It was a great example of a woman from Elnozha, where they support each other. A woman there stopped her son from abusing his wife, so she supported her daughter in law, until the son stopped using violence against his wife. In addition, one of the best messages that I got from one of the participants, saying that: “the workshop changed my life”.

We made the people around us so happy – it was an unusual energy and we all enjoyed it. I was delighted to work with the Ethiopian women because they are suffering from racism in Lebanon, and they really need such projects and workshops to support them psychologically.

		"body": "Clowns without Borders Sweden is a non-profit organization that was founded in Sweden 1996. Since the start, we have met and laughed with about two million children in the world’s crisis areas. Together with our 13 sibling organizations we are a part of Clowns without Borders International. <br/><br/>Our artists are professional clowns, musicians, actors and circus artists who donate their time and talent to the organization in the strong belief that laughter, play and joy makes the world a better place. Through performances and workshops we give children and youths, living in extreme vulnerability, psychosocial support and hope for the future. We also train staff and volunteers from other organizations in our playful and creative methods as a way to share our knowledge and reach more children in need. <br/><br/>Read more about Clowns without Borders Sweden’s work <a href='https://clownerutangranser.se/' target='_blank'>here</a>.

		"question": "How has your participation in the Creative Arts for Peace and Equality project been?",
		"body": "<br/> – My participation in the Creative Arts for Peace and Equality project was a very nice change in my life. It helped to look at aspects of life in a positive way, and I met so many kind people – it was very motivating for me to meet people coming from Palestine. I learnt so many new tools through the project, such as art for equality, clowning, and multimedia. In Syria, we are taught that people have to be serious in life and we have to be grouchy people. In Creative Arts for Peace and Equality I realized that so many problems could be solved by a laugh and art tools, which was a chance for me to renew my energy.",

		"intro": "In the clown part of the training, we worked hard to find the funny side in me. I couldn’t do it and it was very hard – under the war the Syrian people lost a big part of both our humanity and instinct, so it is not easy for us to release our laughter. Arts are a beautiful tool for creating a new connection that we use to renew our energy. We need to bring people back to dreaming, completing a drawing, or making a simple musical instrument – it will be a nice opportunity for participants in such a project.<br/><br/>",
		"question": "And after the training then, how have you used the new knowledge in your local community? Have you seen any change in the participating girls and women?<br/><br/>",
		"body": "– Creative Arts for Peace and Equality has helped to expand the work for women’s health and rights further. Women and girls have trained in using artistic tools, in order to apply them in marginalized societies. This is important work for making change at the societal level, in the long term. There are many refugees who have different problems, and they need to express themselves, especially women. <br/><br/>The goal was to work with women who in their turn can change realities – they are the ones who are working and educating their kids, supporting their husbands who violated them. When the Syrian crisis started, the Syrian women came to Lebanon. Women trained in social therapy to support them in their societies. Vivid examples illustrated the effectiveness of women in their societies. <br/><br/>– I trained a group of women, exploring each one’s strongest point and empowering them, and the group of women started to support each other. I trained the trainers workshop, with ten participants, then they became 20, and we are now 600 women. We were careful to keep the women’s privacy in mind there, since they live in a conservative society, and this is a big achievement for our workshops. <br/><br/>Through sharing their experiences in the workshops, the women realized that they do not have to endure certain things. This led them to be courageous in taking decisions and in changing their realities. For example, when I met a 55-year-old woman, who decided to divorce after a long marriage life full of abuse and violence, this woman got the strength after she participated in one of our workshops, she had the courage to confront tradition and society."

		"question": "How have you continued the work in your local society?<br/><br/>",
		"body": "– The last group I worked with recently was a group of girls who had been subjected to sexual harassment. I felt helpless in this context, but I met with the Palestinian counselor, who advised me to go ahead with this group, and I used the art tools to help this group in breaking the barrier of fear. I also worked with girls who had experienced sexual abuse inside the family, who no-one listened to because they are girls. <br/><br/> Other cases were some women who don’t have good relationships with their husbands and they have no sexual relationships with them. So I believe these types of women and girls need more support to get over their bad experiences in life.",
